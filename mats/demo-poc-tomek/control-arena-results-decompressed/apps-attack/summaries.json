    "input": "Yet another round on DecoForces is coming! Grandpa Maks wanted to participate in it but someone has stolen his precious sofa! And how can one perform well with such a major loss?\n\nFortunately, the thief had left a note for Grandpa Maks. This note got Maks to the sofa storehouse. Still he had no idea which sofa belongs to him as they all looked the same!\n\nThe storehouse is represented as matrix n × m. Every sofa takes two neighbouring by some side cells. No cell is covered by more than one sofa. There can be empty cells.\n\nSofa A is standing to the left of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that x_{a} < x_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Sofa A is standing to the top of sofa B if there exist two such cells a and b that y_{a} < y_{b}, a is covered by A and b is covered by B. Right and bottom conditions are declared the same way. \n\nNote that in all conditions A ≠ B. Also some sofa A can be both to the top of another sofa B and to the bottom of it. The same is for left and right conditions.\n\nThe note also stated that there are cnt_{l} sofas to the left of Grandpa Maks's sofa, cnt_{r} — to the right, cnt_{t} — to the top and cnt_{b} — to the bottom.\n\nGrandpa Maks asks you to help him to identify his sofa. It is guaranteed that there is no more than one sofa of given conditions.\n\nOutput the number of Grandpa Maks's sofa. If there is no such sofa that all the conditions are met for it then output -1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer number d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of sofas in the storehouse.\n\nThe second line contains two integer numbers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the size of the storehouse.\n\nNext d lines contains four integer numbers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1, x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1, y_2 ≤ m) — coordinates of the i-th sofa. It is guaranteed that cells (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) have common side, (x_1, y_1)  ≠  (x_2, y_2) and no cell is covered by more than one sofa.\n\nThe last line contains four integer numbers cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} (0 ≤ cnt_{l}, cnt_{r}, cnt_{t}, cnt_{b} ≤ d - 1).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of the sofa for which all the conditions are met. Sofas are numbered 1 through d as given in input. If there is no such sofa then print -1.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n3 2\n3 1 3 2\n1 2 2 2\n1 0 0 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n3\n10 10\n1 2 1 1\n5 5 6 5\n6 4 5 4\n2 1 2 0\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n2\n2 2\n2 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2\n1 0 0 0\n\nOutput\n-1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's consider the second example.   The first sofa has 0 to its left, 2 sofas to its right ((1, 1) is to the left of both (5, 5) and (5, 4)), 0 to its top and 2 to its bottom (both 2nd and 3rd sofas are below).  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 2 and cnt_{b} = 0.  The third sofa has cnt_{l} = 2, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 1. \n\nSo the second one corresponds to the given conditions.\n\nIn the third example   The first sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 0 and cnt_{b} = 1.  The second sofa has cnt_{l} = 1, cnt_{r} = 1, cnt_{t} = 1 and cnt_{b} = 0. \n\nAnd there is no sofa with the set (1, 0, 0, 0) so the answer is -1.",

    "input": "Anton likes to listen to fairy tales, especially when Danik, Anton's best friend, tells them. Right now Danik tells Anton a fairy tale:\n\n\"Once upon a time, there lived an emperor. He was very rich and had much grain. One day he ordered to build a huge barn to put there all his grain. Best builders were building that barn for three days and three nights. But they overlooked and there remained a little hole in the barn, from which every day sparrows came through. Here flew a sparrow, took a grain and flew away...\"\n\nMore formally, the following takes place in the fairy tale. At the beginning of the first day the barn with the capacity of n grains was full. Then, every day (starting with the first day) the following happens:  m grains are brought to the barn. If m grains doesn't fit to the barn, the barn becomes full and the grains that doesn't fit are brought back (in this problem we can assume that the grains that doesn't fit to the barn are not taken into account).  Sparrows come and eat grain. In the i-th day i sparrows come, that is on the first day one sparrow come, on the second day two sparrows come and so on. Every sparrow eats one grain. If the barn is empty, a sparrow eats nothing. \n\nAnton is tired of listening how Danik describes every sparrow that eats grain from the barn. Anton doesn't know when the fairy tale ends, so he asked you to determine, by the end of which day the barn will become empty for the first time. Help Anton and write a program that will determine the number of that day!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^18) — the capacity of the barn and the number of grains that are brought every day.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer — the number of the day when the barn will become empty for the first time.

The following happens:  At the beginning of the first day grain is brought to the barn. It's full, so nothing happens.  At the end of the first day one sparrow comes and eats one grain, so 5 - 1 = 4 grains remain.  At the beginning of the second day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full and one grain doesn't fit to it.  At the end of the second day two sparrows come. 5 - 2 = 3 grains remain.  At the beginning of the third day two grains are brought. The barn becomes full again.  At the end of the third day three sparrows come and eat grain. 5 - 3 = 2 grains remain.  At the beginning of the fourth day grain is brought again. 2 + 2 = 4 grains remain.  At the end of the fourth day four sparrows come and eat grain. 4 - 4 = 0 grains remain. The barn is empty. \n\nSo the answer is 4, because by the end of the fourth day the barn becomes empty.",

    "input": "Tokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $\\ldots$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $\\ldots$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $\\ldots$, 9s.\n\nIn order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.\n\nDo you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?\n\nHere are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. \n\nSome examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. \n\nNote that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $1$ to $9$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n1s 2s 3s\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n9m 9m 9m\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n3p 9m 2p\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.\n\nIn the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.\n\nIn the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].",

You may perform the following operations until both a and s are empty: Take the first element of a, push it into s and remove it from a (if a is not empty); Take the top element from s, append it to the end of array b and remove it from s (if s is not empty). You can perform these operations in arbitrary order. If there exists a way to perform the operations such that array b is sorted in non-descending order in the end, then array a is called stack-sortable. For example, [3, 1, 2] is stack-sortable, because b will be sorted if we perform the following operations: Remove 3 from a and push it into s; Remove 1 from a and push it into s; Remove 1 from s and append it to the end of b; Remove 2 from a and push it into s; Remove 2 from s and append it to the end of b; Remove 3 from s and append it to the end of b.

Note that both of the statistics update at the same time (so if the player finishes the level successfully then the number of plays will increase at the same time as the number of clears).\n\nPolycarp is very excited about his level, so he keeps peeking at the stats to know how hard his level turns out to be.\n\nSo he peeked at the stats $n$ times and wrote down $n$ pairs of integers — $(p_1, c_1), (p_2, c_2), \\dots, (p_n, c_n)$, where $p_i$ is the number of plays at the $i$-th moment of time and $c_i$ is the number of clears at the same moment of time. The stats are given in chronological order (i.e. the order of given pairs is exactly the same as Polycarp has written down).\n\nBetween two consecutive moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats many players (but possibly zero) could attempt the level.\n\nFinally, Polycarp wonders if he hasn't messed up any records and all the pairs are correct. If there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then he considers his records correct.\n\nHelp him to check the correctness of his records.\n\nFor your convenience you have to answer multiple independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \\le T \\le 500)$ — the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$) — the number of moments of time Polycarp peeked at the stats.\n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($0 \\le p_i, c_i \\le 1000$) — the number of plays and the number of clears of the level at the $i$-th moment of time.\n\nNote that the stats are given in chronological order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single line.\n\nIf there could exist such a sequence of plays (and clears, respectively) that the stats were exactly as Polycarp has written down, then print \"YES\".\n\nOtherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n1 2\n2\n1 0\n1000 3\n4\n10 1\n15 2\n10 2\n15 2\n1\n765 432\n2\n4 4\n4 3\n5\n0 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case at the third moment of time the number of clears increased but the number of plays did not, that couldn't have happened.\n\nThe second test case is a nice example of a Super Expert level.\n\nIn the third test case the number of plays decreased, which is impossible.\n\nThe fourth test case is probably an auto level with a single jump over the spike.\n\nIn the fifth test case the number of clears decreased, which is also impossible.\n\nNobody wanted to play the sixth test case; Polycarp's mom attempted it to make him feel better, however, she couldn't clear it.",
